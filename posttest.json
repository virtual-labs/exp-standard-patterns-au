Suppose you are working on a project that requires a class to represent a configuration manager, which is responsible for reading and writing configuration data used by the application. You need to ensure that only one instance of the configuration manager can exist at any given time.        Which of the following statements about using the Singleton design pattern to implement the configuration manager class is true?",
        "answers": {
          "a": "a.The configuration manager class should have a private constructor, a private static instance variable, and a public static method that returns the single instance of the class.",
